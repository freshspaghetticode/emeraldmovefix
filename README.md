# emeraldmovefix
This repository adds ___ scripts to use with the pokeemerald decomp project:

### addfireredmoves (WIP)

This script modifies the level-up learnsets of all Pokemon that learn different level-up moves in Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen than they do in Emerald.
If a Pokemon learns a move by level-up in FireRed that they do not learn in Emerald, it is added to their level-up learnset.

### addpurifiedmoves (WIP)

This script modifies the level-up learnsets of all Pokemon that can be purified from a shadow Pokemon in Pokemon Colosseum or Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness.
If a Pokemon would have learned a new move by purification, this move will be learnable at the minimum level this Pokemon could have been purified.
These moves can now be learned at a Move Reminder.

### addeventmoves (WIP)

This script modifies the level-up learnsets of all Pokemon with special event moves from game-exclusive trades or past real world events.
If a Pokemon could only obtain a move this way, this move will be added to the beginning of this Pokemon's level-up learnset.
These moves can now be learned at a Move Reminder.

### fireredtutor (WIP)

This is a script for a NPC that offers all move tutor moves that can be obtained in Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen.
By default, this tutor has no usage caps.

### xdtutor (WIP)

This is a script for a NPC that offers all move tutor moves that can be obtained in Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness.
By default, this tutor has no usage caps.

### removetutorcaps (WIP)

This is a script to remove the usage caps on existing move tutors in Emerald.
